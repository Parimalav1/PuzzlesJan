What's an element in HTML? HT Markup Language
An HTML element is a type of HTML document component.

What's a tag in HTML? HTML5-1989
HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how your web browser must format and display the content. 
Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. For example, <html> is the opening tag and </html> is the closing tag.
non-semantic tags: <div>, <span>

What's an attribute in HTML?
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements or data to an element.

CSS -1994, latest-CSS3
Selectors: class/id, rem: Relative to font-size of the root element, em: emphemeral unit

JS - 1994, latest-JS ES6 - Programming language(Python)
A variable is a way to store, change and use data in code. 

Keyword - A word for storing data in memory and assigning that data a ‘key’ that can be used for access 
There are three keywords used to declare/define variables - var, let, and const.
Let - differs by creating “block level scope”.

JavaScript is considered a ‘loosely’ typed language, in which types do exist, but they are not enforced.👇
            You do not have to ✅declare👈 a type when creating a variable or an array, for instance.    👇
let firstName = 'Alice';                                                                                👇
firstName = 'Bob';    👈 👈 👈   👈 👈 👈   👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈 👈

Functions as small computer programs. Functions allow us to write code that will be used over and over again, 
keeping our code DRY (“Don’t Repeat Yourself!”) and declared with keyword function ().
The return statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function. 

Hoisting
The concept of putting a function higher in the execution order for later use is known as hoisting.
It means that function declarations can be invoked or called before they are defined.
Be aware that hoisting applies to function declarations and not function expressions or arrow functions.

Function Expressions and Arrow Function Expressions
Initializing is giving value.
Parameters and arguments allow us to pass data into functions and use this data within the function. 
Parameters-values-arguments. If an argument is not given for a parameter, the parameter will be equal to undefined.

Arrays have index valued items. Arrays are just objects with numerical keys.
Objects are instantiated (created) by using braces ({}). Bracket notation & dot notation
Object oriented programming and functional programming

Properties allow us to access data from a data type, give you a bit of information about that specific object.
Methods allow us to manipulate a data type, built in methods are just functions that they need to have parentheses on the end.
Global objects and methods 👉 the console is a global object and it's method is log.

THIS: Objects have a self-referential keyword that may be applied in each object called this. 
Scope is defined as which variables we currently have access to and where --> global, block level(if statements and for loops), Function Level
Closure -  a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. Global variables can be made local (private) with closures.

Callback functions or higher-order function are just functions that are passed into other functions as parameters or arguments.

Components are reusable pieces of code that can be used to build elements sharing functionality and styling. 
Components are the heart of any dynamic web application and JavaScript framework.
