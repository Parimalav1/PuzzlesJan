# ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Codewars - Replace With Alphabet Position ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
# Level: 6kyu
'''
Problem Description: Welcome. In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter 
with its position in the alphabet. If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return 
it. a being 1, b being 2, etc. As an example:
alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
Should return "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" (As a string.)

def alphabet_position(text):
	  ans = ''
	  inp = list('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')
	  for ch in text:
		  if ch.isalpha():
			  ans += str(inp.index(ch.lower()) + 1) + ' '
	  return ans[0:len(ans)-1]

print(alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock."))

# JavaScript
const alphaPosition = str => [...str]
  .filter(letter => letter.toLowerCase().charCodeAt(0) - 96 > 0)
  .map(letter => letter.toLowerCase().charCodeAt(0) - 96)
  .reduce((s, pos) => s += `${pos} `, '')
  .trim();

# ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Truck Tour -- hackerrank ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ 
# Suppose there is a circle. There are  petrol pumps on that circle. Petrol pumps are numbered  to  (both inclusive). You have two pieces of information corresponding to each of the petrol pump: 
# (1) the amount of petrol that particular petrol pump will give, and (2) the distance from that petrol pump to the next petrol pump. Initially, you have a tank of infinite capacity carrying no petrol. 
# You can start the tour at any of the petrol pumps. Calculate the first point from where the truck will be able to complete the circle. Consider that the truck will stop at each of the petrol pumps. 
# The truck will move one kilometer for each litre of the petrol.

# The first line will contain the value of N.
# The next N lines will contain a pair of integers each, i.e. the amount of petrol that petrol pump will give and the distance between that petrol pump and the next petrol pump.

# Output Format, Sample Output: 1

ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Frequency Queries ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ 
You are given q queries. Each query is of the form two integers described below:
- 1 x : Insert x in your data structure.
- 2 y : Delete one occurence of y from your data structure, if present.
- 3 z: Check if any integer is present whose frequency is exactly z. If yes, print 1 else 0.
The queries are given in the form of a 2-D array queries of size q where queries[i][0] contains the operation, and
queries[i][1] contains the data element. For example, you are given array . 
queries = [(1,1),(2,2),(3,2),(1,1),(1,1),(2,1) ],(3,2)]. The results of each operation are:
Operation   Array   Output:[0,1]
(1,1)       [1]
(2,2)       [1]
(3,2)                   0
(1,1)       [1,1]
(1,1)       [1,1,1]
(2,1)       [1,1]
(3,2)                   1

Input Format
The first line contains of an integer q, the number of queries.
Each of the next q lines contains two integers denoting the 2-d array queries.

Output Format
Return an integer array consisting of all the outputs of queries of type 3.
